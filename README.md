> Evaluation Tools for Football Manager 26

Welcome to the player and staff evaluation tool

## Description
After numerous tests on Football Manager in recent years, Kinito and DoctorDim have allowed us to understand important aspects of the game in depth. Using their work for the community, I was able to create this small tool that will help you better understand the management of your squad and your club.

## Features
- **Hidden Attributes**: Evaluate a player's hidden attributes using: Personality, Media Handling, Determination
- **Staff**: Evaluate staff to best meet your needs. In FM26, attributes are displayed with descriptive words.
- **Reports**: Interpret different reports: Scout, Coach, Individual Training
- **Infrastructure**: Know and evaluate your club's infrastructure development.

Based on work by Gilgiltsu, Kinito & DoctorDim
